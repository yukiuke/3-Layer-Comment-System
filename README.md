# 3-Layer-Comment-System

Uses cloud storage for jQuery/Bootstrap, so internet is required. Uses JSONDB as the database.

## Install:
Not much to do, simply clone/download and extract to a **PHP 5.6+** server. Navigate to **./views/comments.html.php** in a modern browser and begin entering comments below the title.

Next iteration should use **Materialized Path** data structure.
